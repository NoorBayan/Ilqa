Ilqa is an AI-driven audio enhancement project designed to improve the quality of Quranic recitations and exegesis (tafsir) readings. Utilizing advanced speech processing and enhancement technologies, the project focuses on refining the clarity, tone, and accessibility of Quranic audio for educational purposes. The system works by enhancing the reciter's voice, ensuring that the recitation is clear, accurate, and easy to follow. This project aims to provide listeners with a high-quality audio experience of the Quran and its interpretations, supporting both learning and spiritual engagement.
